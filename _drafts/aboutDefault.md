Hi I'm Jean, a Computer Science student with nearly 15 years work experience in 
public health motivated to further my theoretical and practical skills in quality 
design, implementation and testing of software and hardware architectures.  
I divide and conquer challenges so that what I build can unite and help prosper 
the initiatives I take on.  I have exceptional interpersonal skills with the 
determination to resolve complex computing challenges.  I have demonstrated the 
ability to learn quickly, apply new concepts, adapt to change and communicate 
fluently in both French and English.
